This API retrieves data about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/paye-for-employers">PAYE for employers (ePAYE)</a>. It provides the following information:

* ePAYE balance including any interest owed
* monthly totals of Real Time Information (RTI) charges
* non-RTI charges
* breakdown of individual charges

This information is intended for use by employers and their agents to check their own calculations of their clients' tax liability.

This version of the API is currently in development and is very likely to be enhanced.

# Update 11th Feb 2020
Checked with Jacky Hanley with regard to decomissioning this repository, her response is to not decomission it as HMRC have a bid for funding (SR20) to make it fit for purpose and extend it to cover employee-level data.
